# Railway-Reservation-System-using-C-with-Report

This  system  is  basically  concerned  with  the  reservation  and cancellation  of  railway  tickets  to  the  passengers. To be more specific, our system is limited in such a way that a train starting  from  a  particular  source will  have  a  single  destination.

### :woman_technologist: Introduction

India is the 7th largest country in terms of geographical size. This means there is a need for efficient means
for long distance transportation. The long distance road network is very poorly developed in most
parts of India. Bulk of long distance traffic is carried by the Indian Railway as a result Indian
railways. Therefore, forms a backbone of public transport in India. The efficiency of the railway will
increase result of computerization due to dramatic reduction in communication time among
geographically dispersed offices. For the reservation of the ticket a person goes to ticket counter of
the railway reservation office and expend its valuable time in standing queue. Now to save that time we
have a facility of Online Reservation now just by click on computer.

This project will give us the information about railway reservation.

### :zap: Conclusion

Practical learning is a very important part of the curriculum as it strengthens the concept and enhances
knowledge about the practical implementation of all theory concepts we have learnt in the SDF.
I have tried to use all the concepts which have been taught in SDF like array, structure, function, if else and
switch case. The project that we made books ticket easily and without any error. Flowchart helps to
understand the project very simply. Finally, the system is implemented and tested according to test cases.
